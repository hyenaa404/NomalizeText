as you can see  , detecting whether a string is normalized can be quite efficient. a lot of the cost of normalizing in the " second row " is for the initialization of buffers. The cost of which is amortized when one is processing larger strings.

 as it turns out,these buffers are rarely needed . so we may change the implementation at some point to speed up the common case for small strings even further
